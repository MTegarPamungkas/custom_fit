Application Name : CustomFit </p>
Team Description: Currently the trend in the world of fashion is growing, many people are starting to be interested in making their own clothes with the models they want. However, there is a problem, namely the difficulty of designing the desired clothing model when experiencing limited distance to the tailor. Based on this, the author created an innovative application that can help users create their own clothing models based on generative AI and directly connect the results of their custom clothing to the tailor. This application encourages innovation in the fashion sector and achieves SDGS to SDG 9, namely supporting Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure.</p>
